# This is a simple sass compiler with gulp #

### To get started: ###

* Clone this repo
* NPM install the project
* Run 'gulp sass-watcher' in your terminal
* All your sass/scss files go into the src/scss folder
* gulp automatically listens for changes to the scss files or any new scss files added to the folder
* All your scss files will first be concatenated into one large style.scss file, and then into one large css file in dist/css
